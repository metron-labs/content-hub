# --- Shared Description Constants ---

ACTION_AI_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Detailed description that will be used by LLMs to understand what the action does."
    " This should be an informative summary of the action's purpose and expected outcome."
    " Use markdown formatting for clarity, as this is a description for LLMs."
    " The description must be divided into 3 distinct sections: 'General Description',"
    " 'Flow Description', and 'Additional Notes'."
    " Under the 'Flow Description' section, please add a description of the flow of the action"
    " in numbered or bulleted points to describe each stage of the action logically."
    " If an API call is being made during the execution of this action, it must be explicitly"
    " mentioned and detailed within this flow description."
)

ACTION_AI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION = (
    "A concise, high-level summary of the action's primary purpose and expected outcome."
    " This should be a direct, single-paragraph distillation of the 'General Description'"
    " designed for quick LLM parsing, completely free of step-by-step flow overhead"
    " or parameter details."
)

PARAMETERS_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Detailed description of the action's parameters, formatted using markdown for LLM clarity."
    "CRITICAL SOURCE CONSTRAINT: You must extract parameter information EXCLUSIVELY from the action's "
    "parameters list (under 'Parameters' or 'parameters' key in the metadata definitions). You "
    "are strictly forbidden from including, inferring, or falling back to any integration-level parameters "
    "(including parameters retrieved via siemplify.extract_configuration_param or listed under "
    "integration-level configurations)."
    "Create a table that describes these action-specific parameters with the following columns: "
    "Parameter, Type, Mandatory, Description."
    "The Description column should explain how to use the parameter and how it might affect the action's flow."
    "If there are no action-specific parameters defined, you must NOT generate a table. Instead, "
    "set this field value exactly to: 'There are no parameters for this action'."
    "If a parameter is not mandatory but code execution requires it based on the presence of other "
    "parameters, mention this relationship within its specific row description, or add an optional "
    "'Parameter Notes' section below the table (e.g., 'Either this set of parameters or this set of "
    "parameters must be configured')."
)

ENTITY_USAGE_DESCRIPTION = (
    "A detailed set of properties that describe how the action uses entities."
    " Determine each of the fields by going over the code."
)

OUTCOME_CATEGORIES_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Describes what the action achieves - its expected outcomes."
    " This field classifies the action based on what it does, rather than how it operates."
)

CAPABILITIES_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Fields that describe how the action operates. Determine these fields based on the"
    " metadata json and the code itself."
)
